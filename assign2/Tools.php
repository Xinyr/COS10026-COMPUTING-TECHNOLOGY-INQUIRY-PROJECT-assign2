                <hr>
                <p class="tutorialPara">a pair of pruning clippers for use with one hand. They are designed to make clean cuts on stems, branches, and flowers, helping to promote healthy growth, minimal the damage to plants and maintain the shape of plants.</p>
                <p class="tutorialPara">There are two main types:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bypass secateurs</li>
                    <li>Anvil secateurs</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="tutorialPara">Bypass secateurs, which have a scissor-like action and are great for live stems while Anvil secateurs, which have a straight blade that cuts against a flat surface, suitable for dead wood. The one we used here are bypass secataur.</p>

                    <p class="tutorialPara">Vasculum is a botanical collecting bag used by plant collectors and botanists to store and transport specimens. It is mostly made with lightweight yet durable material such as aluminium and tin. Vasculum could be important for herbarium as it protect the specimens from sun's UV rays, raindrops and hot winds during transportation, delaying the withering of the specimens.</p>

It is choosen over normal paper due to it's neutral characteristic that is better for the specimens long term preservation.</p>
