                <hr>
                <p class="tutorialPara">First step to start your herbarium journey would be by collecting leaves, and picking suitable location will ease your work. The location examples are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Park</li>
                    <li>Garden</li>
                    <li>Meadow</li>
                    <li>Forest</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="tutorialPara">Then, when it come to leaves collecting, make sure you collect fresh leaves cutted from trees instead of withered leaves. Withered leaves are easy to chip and fragile to handle hence not suitable for herbarium. Place the collected leaves in Vasculum so it is protected from sun's UV rays, rain drops and hot air during transportation.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="tutorialPara">After reaching home, wash the leaves with clean water to remove dust and dirt. Then, remove excess moisture by wiping the leaves with a paper towel. After that, place a piece of parchment paper above and below the leaves before pressing. Also remember to arrange carefully so no leaves overlap each others to make sure all leaves could dry off evenly.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="tutorialPara">The next step would be placing the leaves that are within the layer of parchment paper into the herbarium press. After the press is fully loaded, start apply pressure to make the leaves flat and fasten the drying. Make sure the leaves are flat enough or else it will bubbling. Use suitable items for pressing such as heavy books, but do beware not to put too heavy object for pressing as it will crush and damage the leaves.</p>

                    <p>The concept of herbaria can first be trace back to 16th century, by a Botany Professor named Luca Ghini (1490?-1556) and the term herbarium is first known as a collection of dried medicinal plants cataloged within a bound book which was a bit different with the modern meaning of a systematically arranged collection of dried plants.</p>
